      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As Pakistan rapidly embraces digital transformation, freelancing is no
        longer limited to basic writing or small design projects. In 2025,
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the backbone of freelancing
        success — helping individuals deliver professional-quality results at
        lightning speed.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        From content creation and translation to video editing and client
        communication, AI tools allow freelancers to stay competitive in global
        marketplaces like Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn. But here’s the challenge:
        not every tool works smoothly in Pakistan, and not all of them handle Urdu
        + English workflows equally well.

        AI vs. Human Creativity: Can Machines Really Replace Freelancers?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        While AI is powerful, it’s not here to replace you. Instead, it enhances
        your work. AI can generate drafts, automate repetitive tasks, or
        translate text into Urdu — but freelancers still provide the human touch,
        cultural nuance, and problem-solving skills that clients value. Think of
        AI as your assistant, not your replacement.
